Module Syllabus   2023/24
Key   Module   Information 
Module Code: ECOM193 
Module Title: Statistical Machine Learning in Finance 
Credit Value:   15
Level:   7   (MSc)
Semester: C   (3)
Prerequisites:    Ideally, students should   have taken an   elementary   course   in   statistics
previously. Some   knowledge of linear algebra and a   little   high school   calculus   would   also   be      useful.   Prior knowledge of the   R (https://www.r-project.org/) free software environment would   be advantageous   but   is   not essential as lecture and tutorial   class   guidance will   be   given.
Module   Delivery 
Each week you will be expected to engage with   material and   exercises   (independent   learning activities)   posted on the   module’s QMplus page, alongside   attending   and
participating in scheduled teaching activities.
Details of the scheduled teaching activities will be in   your timetable.   This   can   be   accessed   via the   My Timetable option   in QMplus.
Lecture 
Lectures are on Wednesdays 3–5pm • GC:305
Tutorials are on   Fridays   12–1pm • Queens:QB-213
Classes 
Details of your class allocation can be found   in   MyTimetable on   QMplus.
Module Content 
Module Aim 
The aim of this module is   to give   students   a   good   understanding   of the foundations   of
statistical   machine learning and the use of selected   methods   in finance.   There   is   a   strong   emphasis on   practical application using   R to model the   provided   datasets.
Learning Outcomes 
Upon completion of this module, students should   have a   good   grasp   of statistical   machine
learning and   be able to undertake their own   ML   projects   in a   relatively   unsupervised   manner.

Reading   List 
[ISLR] James, G., Witten,   D,   Hastie, T. and   Tibshirani,   R.   (2021) An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R. Second edition. Springer-Verlag,   New York.
ISLR is the main textbook   for   the   course.   It   also   focuses   on undertaking   analyses
using R. The book can be used   as   a   complementary   guide   to   the ML   methods   introduced   in lectures. Module topics are   covered   largely   in   ISLR   chapter   order   (Lectures
1–8). Course examples and datasets   are, however,   quite   different   to   ISLR   as   they      are tailored to finance. The   book   is   freely   available online.   (A   2023   edition   due   out shortly will cover   the   same   material   in   Python.)
[ESL]   Hastie, T., Tibshirani,   R. and   Friedman, J. (2009) The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction. Second edition. Springer-Verlag,   New York.
ESL is a popular book detailing   nearly   all   of   the   topics   contained   in   the module.   It generally covers topics   in a   little   more   depth   than   ISLR.   A   corrected   12th
printing of the entire book   as   of   January   2017   is   available online.
[MSDA]   Rice, J.A. (2006) Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis. Third edition.   Brooks   Cole,   Belmont, CA.
Students may find this book useful   for   statistical   concepts   such as   bias,   variance
and   likelihood.
[CASI]   Efron,   B. and   Hastie, T. (2016) Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science. Cambridge   University   Press,   New York.
For students wishing to delve   into the   subject   area   more   deeply.   CASI   describes   the   revolution in data analysis following   the   introduction   of   electronic   computation   in   the 1950s. Many of the module   topics   are   covered   by   CASI   but   it   is   a   harder   more technical read than   both   ISLR   and   ESL.
Assessment 
Assessment   is by quiz (three online   multiple choice tests   during   the   semester),   midterm coursework and a lengthier project (in-depth   coursework)   rather   than   by   timed   examination.
